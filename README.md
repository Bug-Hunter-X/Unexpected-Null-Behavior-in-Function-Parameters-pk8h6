# Unexpected Null Behavior in Function Parameters

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript functions when dealing with `null` values as parameters. The `foo` function exhibits unexpected behavior when one or both of its parameters are `null`, returning `null` instead of handling the situation more robustly.

The bug is demonstrated in `bug.js`, and a possible solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
